*Overview*

This project presents a predictive analytics approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. It is designed as an Internet of Things (IoT) application to analyze and forecast traffic trends based on historical data. Our model leverages a comprehensive dataset detailing 14.3 million Uber pickups in New York City from the first half of 2015, aiming to predict traffic conditions and future demand within an urban setting.

*Data Source*
The data for this project was sourced from the following repository: [FiveThirtyEight's Uber TLC Foil Response](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response).

*Project Description*
The project outlines developing a machine learning-based IoT system for processing and analyzing historical traffic pattern data. By implementing a blend of decision tree classifiers and LSTM networks, we aim to extract meaningful insights from raw sensor data collected in dense urban environments. Our analysis process involves:

Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and trends in the data.
Model Training: Employing machine learning algorithms to forecast traffic demand.
Visualization: Displaying our findings on a Tableau Public dashboard for straightforward interpretation and decision-making.
Our methodology demonstrates the integration of IoT systems with advanced data analytics to improve urban mobility planning and service delivery.

Visualization
Our findings are visualized on a Tableau Public dashboard to provide an intuitive understanding of urban traffic demands. You can access the dashboard here: [Traffic Trends Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prachi.khanna/viz/IOTFinalProject/UberPickupPrediction).
